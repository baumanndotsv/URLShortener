    # By default, Contao adds ".html" to the generated URLs to simulate static
    # HTML documents. If you change the URL suffix in the back end settings, make
    # sure to change it here accordingly!
    #
    #   RewriteRule .*\.html$ index.php [L]   # URL suffix .html
    #   RewriteRule .*\.txt$ index.php [L]    # URL suffix .txt
    #   RewriteRule .*\.json$ index.php [L]   # URL suffix .json
    #
    # If you do not want to use an URL suffix at all, you have to add a second
    # line to prevent URLs that point to folders from being rewritten (see #4031).
    #
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(\.|/$)
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /krossmediakit/$1.html [R=301,L]
    #
    # If you are using mod_cache, it is recommended to use the RewriteRule below,
    # which adds the query string to the internal URL:
    #
    #   RewriteRule (.*\.html)$ index.php/$1 [L]
    #
    # Note that not all environments support mod_rewrite and mod_cache.
